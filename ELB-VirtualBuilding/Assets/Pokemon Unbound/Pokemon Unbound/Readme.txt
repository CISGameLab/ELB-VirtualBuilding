Patch the game with Pokemon Fire Red (U)(Squirrels)

Things to Note:
1) Poke Balls don't appear correctly on the status screen and when a Pokemon is sent out
2) Certain moves do not have the proper move effect corresponding to what they should do.  Damaging moves in this list still do damage but do not have their effect:
	-Copycat
	-Miracle Eye
	-Healing Wish
	-Lunar Dance
	-Tailwind
	-Final Gambit
	-Retaliate
	-Chip Away
	-Natural Gift
	-Gyro Ball
3) Simple does not yet change stat decreases, but will double stat boosts
4) If a Pokemon tries to learn a move labeled as "-" don't teach it this move. It is simply a place holder until the move it should be, is ready.
5) TMs do not have the right TM number, but still teach the correct move.  For example, Hone Claws is HM No6 but will
   teach your pokemon Hone Claws.
6) Speeding up a battle occasionally results in the screen becoming two colors after battle. If this happens turn on the sounds and save the game (not state).
   If you restart the game then the problem should be fixed. Alternatively, starting a wild or trainer battle also fixes this problem/
7) Most Pokemon evolve via their evolution method in the normal games. However Pokemon that
evolve through trading now evolve via an item called "Link Cable" (not available in the demo).
Pokemon that evolve via trading with an item, now evolve by using their respective item on them
like a stone.
8) Attempting to use link features will freeze the music

Enjoy Playing!
