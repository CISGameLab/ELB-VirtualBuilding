* Has glass parts that are parented via the main object (e.g. glass door and frame) that are assigned with a texture which has a transparency value).
** These parts have other interchangeable variations that can connect with each other to form a different arrangement.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Assets such as walls, carpet, and ceiling tiles have their default pivot on the lower right of the geometry. In order to seamlessly connect them with each other, please follow the steps below (via Unity) to snap selected geometry to vertex point of another asset in the scene.  Note: These instructions work only with the Move Tool.

1. Select geometry
2. Press W to use Move Tool
3. Press and hold V on the keyboard, and hover your mouse pointer to an edge of the selected geometry to move the pivot to your mouse pointer location
4. To move and snap to another vertex point, click and drag the middle part of the gizmo to another geometry you’d like to connect it to

xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx

NOTES:

1. All the pivots on the assets are assigned to the models bottom edges so users can align them easily

2. Models with textures that have transparency (such as the glass window, glass door, coffee maker, reception table, and the water dispenser) have the transparent parts parented on it’s non-transparent parts. A good example is the glass door, which has a frame, the door and the handle. The glass door that is parented to the handle has a separate material that has an alpha (TGA) and the other parts (handles and the frame) have none (png)

3. When you opt to design your own customized layout, please also review the 3 ready-made offices (small, medium, and large ones) to get a better understanding on how each parts connect with one another

4. Check out the textures folder contained in the zip file to see the editable texture psd files

5. UV groups with alphas are groups 3, 4, and 6 and are assigned a separate material

6. Parts like the walls, ceilings, and tiled floors has different sizes & shapes that can be scaled to match the users preference

7. A time saving tip: Upon making a custom layout, you should consider laying out the floor first before the walls so that you can make the walls fit to the floor shape easily.
