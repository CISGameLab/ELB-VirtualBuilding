In the folder "Demo" you will find two scenes which show an example of how to use the package.
The "Baked" scene is intended for fully baked lighting, the "Realtime with GI" scene is intended for realtime lighting.
Bake the lighting in the scenes with our preset lighting settings to get the look from the screenshots and video.

In the folder "Prefabs" you will find prefabs ready to be dragged into your scene.

In the foldes "Meshes", "Textures" and "Materials" you will find all the corresponding resources used in the prefabs.

To get the look from the screenshots and videos in the "Baked" scene download and use Unity's Post Processing Stack.
Thank you for buying our pack!
